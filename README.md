# OOP Dublin Bikes 

## Project Description: 
	Creation of a database allowing us to keep track of the number of bikes present at each bike store.
	Implented functions that allow us to use "get", "post", "delete", "put" request over our database.

## Last Modifications 
```
	Completion of controller files.
	Creation of Views for "create", "edit", "detail", "remove" functions
	Creation of Html file coresponding to the "create", "edit", "detail" and "remove" Views
```

## Individual Tasks:
```
Ilias --> Implement "get" and "post" requests functions
Guilhem --> Implement "put" and "delete" requests functions
Nael --> Create Html and CSS table
Anton -> Create the database
Marin -> Create class Models
Julien -> Creation of a Readme and modify some controllers file
```

## Future Tasks
Modify and if possible enhance the View files

## PS 
We know that adding our appseting.json to the git is not a good idea but you need it to connect to our database, it's password will be changed in a little time
